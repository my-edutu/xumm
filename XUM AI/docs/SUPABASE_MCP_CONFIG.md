# Supabase MCP Configuration

This project is configured to work with the **Supabase MCP Server**. This allows AI assistants (like Cursor, Claude Desktop, or Windsurf) to directly interact with your Supabase database, execute SQL, manage Edge Functions, and more.

## Quick Setup

To add this project to your AI assistant's MCP configuration, use the following settings:

### Configuration JSON
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supabase": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp?project_ref=gkhemshbwmealgxczykk"
    }
  }
}
```

## Recommended Options

You can customize the functionality by modifying the URL query parameters:

| Option | Recommended Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `project_ref` | `gkhemshbwmealgxczykk` | Scopes the server to this specific project. |
| `read_only` | `true` | Restricts the server to read-only queries (recommended for safety). |
| `features` | `database,docs,debugging,development,functions,branching` | List of tool groups to enable. |

### Security Optimized URL (Read-Only)
`https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp?project_ref=gkhemshbwmealgxczykk&read_only=true`

### Full Access URL (Developer Mode)
`https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp?project_ref=gkhemshbwmealgxczykk&read_only=false`

---

## Available Tools
Once configured, the AI will have access to:
- **Database**: List tables, execute SQL, apply migrations.
- **Functions**: List, read, and deploy Edge Functions.
- **Debugging**: Fetch logs and advisory notices.
- **Knowledge Base**: Search Supabase documentation.
- **Branching**: Manage development branches (paid plans).

## Security Best Practices
- **Manual Approval**: Always keep "require approval for tool calls" enabled in your IDE settings.
- **Environment**: Use development projects instead of production whenever possible.
- **Review**: Review the SQL generated by the assistant before executing.
