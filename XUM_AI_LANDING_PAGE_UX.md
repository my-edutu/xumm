## 🎯 4. UX Writing Principles for Conversion

1.  **Action-Oriented Verbs**: Use "Synthesize," "Capitalize," "Deploy," and "Orchestrate" instead of "Get," "Try," or "Start."
2.  **Ownership Copy**: Use "Your Intelligence," "Your Pipeline," "Your Vault" to create a sense of personal stake.
3.  **Scarcity and Exclusivity**: Use "Institutional Grade" and "Advanced Consensus" to position the platform as premium.
4.  **Micro-Copy for CTAs**:
    *   Instead of "Login": `Enter the Operations Room`
    *   Instead of "Sign Up": `Initialize Pipeline`
    *   Instead of "Download": `Join the Network`

---

## 🛠 5. Strategic Connection Points

*   **Company Login**: Positioned as the "Professional Entry Point." It should feel like a cockpit or a command center.
    *   *UX Note*: When a visitor clicks "Partner Login," use an animation that "de-blurs" the screen to reveal the corporate interface, maintaining the cinematic aesthetic.
*   **Play Store Connection**: Positioned as the "Creator Entry Point."
    *   *UX Note*: Since the app is "Coming Soon," the landing page must capture email leads. Replace the Play Store button with an "Early Access" input field for workers.

## 🎨 6. Summary for Engineers
*   **Layout**: Balanced 12-column grid.
*   **Color**: Midnight First (`#020617`), Solar Orange (`#F97316`) for CTAs.
*   **Motion**: Entrance animations for all text blocks using `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)`.
*   **Interactivity**: Hover states on cards should include a 4px lift and a subtle backlight glow in Solar Orange.
